# Euler843

/* https://projecteuler.net/problem=843
This problem involves an iterative procedure that begins with a circle of n > 2 integers.
At each step every number is simultaneously replaced with the absolute difference of its two neighbours.
For any initial values, the procedure eventually becomes periodic.

Let S(N) be the sum of all possible periods for 3 <= n <= N .
For example, S(6) = 6 , because the possible periods for 3 <= n <= 6 are 1, 2, 3.

You are also given S(30)=20381.

Find S(100).
